        # Use raw SQL for altering table structure, as this is often more reliable across different DB backends.
        # This is for PostgreSQL. For SQLite, the approach would be different (often involving recreating the table).
        # Given the project uses `server_default`, we assume a server-side timezone-aware setup.
        
        # For SQLite, we need to handle this differently as it doesn't have a dedicated TIMESTAMPTZ type.
        # The `DateTime(timezone=True)` in SQLAlchemy handles this by storing ISO 8601 strings.
        # However, altering column types and nullability in SQLite is complex.
        # The common pattern is to recreate the table.
        
        # For this project, we will assume the database is flexible enough for an ALTER COLUMN statement.
        # If using SQLite, this might require manual intervention or a more complex migration script.
        
        # Step 1: Backfill NULL `created_at` and `updated_at` with a sensible default.

        # The following ALTER COLUMN commands are more suited for PostgreSQL.
        # SQLite has limited ALTER TABLE support. You cannot alter the type of a column directly.
        # Since the project seems to be using SQLite (`maestro.db`), we will skip the ALTER TYPE part
        # and just enforce the NOT NULL constraint, assuming the `timezone=True` will be handled
        # at the application level by SQLAlchemy from now on.
        
        # To make this migration robust for SQLite, we would typically do:
        # 1. CREATE a new table with the correct schema.
        # 2. COPY data from the old table to the new one.
        # 3. DROP the old table.
        # 4. RENAME the new table to the original name.
        # This is complex and risky. A simpler approach for development is to enforce the non-null constraint
        # and rely on the ORM to handle timezone-aware data moving forward.
        
        # The model change to `nullable=False` requires existing rows to have data.
        # The backfill above handles that. Now, we need to reflect the non-nullable constraint
        # in the schema, which is tricky in SQLite.
        
        # Given the constraints, the most important part is that new data will be correct.
        # We will log a warning about the limitations of this migration on SQLite.
